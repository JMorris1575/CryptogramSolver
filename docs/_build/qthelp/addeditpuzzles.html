<h1>Adding and Editing Puzzles in a Collection</h1>
<img alt="_images/AddEditPuzzleDialog.png" src="_images/AddEditPuzzleDialog.png" />
<p>Administrators of Cryptogram Solver can add puzzles, edit or delete existing puzzles in a collection.  The Add/Edit
Collection dialog box appears when you have clicked the <strong>Add New Puzzle</strong> button, (See: <a class="reference internal" href="addcollection.html"><span class="doc">Adding a New Collection</span></a>.) when
you have selected <strong>Edit Puzzles</strong> from the Admin menu, or when you have clicked the [] icon on the task bar.  When
editing the puzzles of an existing collection this dialog box will be set to edit the current puzzle when you first
enter it but that may be changed by use of the <strong>Puzzle Selector</strong>.</p>
<p>The following chart outlines the use of the dialog box:</p>
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="26%" />
<col width="74%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-odd"><td><strong>Add New Puzzle</strong></td>
<td>Click this button to add a new puzzle to the current collection.
Clicking this button will clear whatever may be displayed and start
you with a clean slate for creating a new puzzle.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><strong>Puzzle Selector</strong></td>
<td>This combo box contains the names of existing puzzles, if any, and
can be used to select a puzzle to work on.  When adding a new
puzzle this is blank until the Store Puzzle button is pressed.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><strong>Puzzle Name</strong></td>
<td>Type the desired name of the puzzle into this box or keep the
default which is Puzzle n, where n is the next number at the end of
the sequence of puzzles.  If you use that format (Puzzle n) for an
existing puzzle, that puzzle, and all of the puzzles after it, will
be shifted up in the list and their numbers adjusted accordingly.
This gives you the ability to, for instance, insert a puzzle you
have forgotten.  If there are gaps in the sequence you can fill
them the same way.  If you do not use the Puzzle n format and you
type the name of an existing puzzle you will be asked if you want
to replace the existing puzzle when you press the <strong>Store</strong> button.
Every puzzle must have a name so if this  box is blank, none of the
rest of the controls will be activated</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><strong>Puzzle Code</strong></td>
<td>Type the cryptogram itself into this box.  The characters you type
will automatically be converted to upper case.  Every puzzle must
have a code so if this box is blank, none of the rest of the
controls will be activated.  There must be an entry in this box
before the <strong>Store</strong> button will be activated.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><strong>Citation Code</strong>
<strong>(if any)</strong></td>
<td>If the puzzle is a quote from a particular source, and the
citation is part of the puzzle, type its code here.  It needs to
to follow the same key as the puzzle code.  In other words, if A=K
in the main puzzle, A=K in the citation code too.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><strong>Puzzle Solution</strong>
<strong>(optional)</strong></td>
<td>Type the solution to the puzzle in this box.  The characters you
type will automatically be converted to upper case.  If you want to
use Cryptogram Solver to find the solution yourself, you may leave
this blank for now and save the solution after solving it by
clicking &#8220;Save Solution&#8221; on the Admin menu.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><strong>Citation Solution</strong>
<strong>(optional)</strong></td>
<td>Type the citation, if any, as to the source of this puzzle in this
box.  As with the puzzle solution, you may leave this blank and
save it later by using Cryptogram Solver to solve the puzzle
yourself and then clicking <strong>Save Solution</strong> on the Admin menu.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><strong>Hints (optional)</strong></td>
<td>Some cryptogram books come with hints as to the solutions of the
puzzles.  These hints, if any, can be entered here separated by
semicolons.  For example, if you enter <strong>A=K; B=Q</strong> into the box,
the first hint given when the user clicks &#8220;Get Hint&#8221; on the puzzle
menu is that A=K.  That is, all appearances of the letter A in the
puzzle code will have the solution slots above them replaced with
the letter K.  If the user clicks &#8220;Get Hint&#8221; again, the letter Q
will be filled in above all occurences of the letter B.  This will
continue for as long as there are hints remaining.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><strong>Delete</strong></td>
<td>If you want to delete the puzzle currently listed in the Puzzle
Selector box, click this button.  You will be asked to confirm the
deletion.  If you do, the puzzle will be deleted from the
collection which cannot be undone.  If this puzzle was selected in
the main program, the main program&#8217;s current puzzle will be changed
to the next one, if possible, or the previous one if this was the
last.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><strong>Clear</strong></td>
<td>Press this button to clear all of the Add or Edit Puzzle controls.
This provides a quick means of erasing extensive mistakes.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><strong>Save</strong></td>
<td>Once you have entered at least the Puzzle Name and Puzzle Code,
this button will be activated and you can click it to save the
puzzle.  If this is a new puzzle you are adding to the collection,
it&#8217;s name will be added to the <strong>Puzzle Selector</strong>.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><strong>Cancel</strong></td>
<td>Closes the Add or Edit Puzzles dialog box without making any
further changes.  Every puzzle that was previously saved during the
session will, however, still be saved.</td>
</tr>
