<h1>Adding a New Collection</h1>

<p>An administrator can add Collections to the system by means of the dialog box above.  A Collection consists of its
name, its author (if given) and a list of puzzles.  Collections are contained in files ending with a &#8221;.col&#8221; extension
and saved in the main program&#8217;s &#8220;Collections&#8221; directory.  The dialog box above is used to create the bare bones of a
collection, that is, its name and author, and create the file on disk.  Puzzles need to be added later.  See
<a class="reference internal" href="addeditpuzzles.html"><span class="doc">Adding and Editing Puzzles in a Collection</span></a>.  The following chart outlines the use of the <strong>Add Collection</strong> dialog box.</p>
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="26%" />
<col width="74%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-odd"><td><strong>Collection Name:</strong></td>
<td>Enter a name for this collection.  The name you choose will be used
to create a file name for the collection which will be saved in the
Collections directory in the game&#8217;s main directory.  The file name
created by the program can be changed later, if you so desire, by
the normal means provided by your computer&#8217;s operating system.  The
Collection Name entered here will not be affected.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><strong>Author (optional):</strong></td>
<td>This could be the author of the book from which the puzzles come,
the name of the magazine, or it can be left blank.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><strong>Create Collection</strong></td>
<td>This button is activated once the Collection name is entered.  Click
it to save the collection.  Once the collection is saved, you may
add puzzles by clicking the <strong>Add Puzzles</strong> button (see below).</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><strong>Cancel</strong></td>
<td>Click this button to close this dialog box without saving anything
to the local disk.  No changes you made will be saved.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>A new collection is pretty worthless without puzzles.  After creating a new collection you still need to add puzzles.
See <a class="reference internal" href="addeditpuzzles.html"><span class="doc">Adding and Editing Puzzles in a Collection</span></a> for more information.</p>
