<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Cryptogram Solver is a program to assist in the solution of cryptogram puzzles.</p>
<p>Once a user has logged in, a process used solely to keep track of that user&#8217;s
completed puzzles, he or she can select a puzzle collection and a puzzle to
solve within that collection.  Using the mouse, or the arrow keys, a letter
from the puzzle can be selected and then, using the keyboard or the mouse on
the on-screen keyboard, a possible solution letter is selected.  The program
automatically fills that letter in for all the instances of the code letter that
appear in the puzzle.</p>
<p>When the user completes a puzzle he or she can click the &#8220;Check Solution&#8221; button,
or its entry in the Puzzle menu.  If a solution is available, the user will be told
whether their solution matches the stored solution.  If there is not yet a solution
available the user will be asked if they want to save their solution.  If the user
is an administrator he or she can save the solution to Cryptogram Solver&#8217;s puzzle
collection files.</p>
