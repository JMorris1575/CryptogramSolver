Collections are added to the system by means of the dialog box above.  The following outlines the use of the dialog box:

+------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Collection Name:       | Enter a name for this collection.  The name you choose will be used |
|                        | to create a file name for the collection which will be saved in the |
|                        | Collections directory in the game's main directory.                 |
|                        | After a collection name is entered the "Add New Puzzle" button will |
|                        | be activated.                                                       |
+------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Author of this         | The author of the book from which the puzzles come, or the name of  |
| Collection:            | the magazine, etc.  This entry is optional.                         |
+------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Add New Puzzle         | A new collection is pretty worthless without new puzzles.  Click    |
|                        | this button to activate the Add or Edit Puzzles section below.      |
|                        | For instructions on adding or editing puzzles see                   |
|                        | :doc:`addeditpuzzles`.                                              |
+------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Store Collection       | This button is activated once the Collection name is entered.  Click|
|                        | it to save the collection.                                          |
+------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Cancel                 | Click this button to close this dialog box without saving anything  |
|                        | to the local disk.  No changes you made will be saved.              |
